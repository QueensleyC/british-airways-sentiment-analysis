# British Airways Sentiment Analysis

## Roberta Sentiment Analysis Internship Project
### Description
This repository contains the code and resources for my internship project, where I leveraged the Roberta model for sentiment analysis. During my internship, I explored and implemented sentiment analysis tasks using state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.

### Model
The success of sentiment analysis tasks heavily relies on the quality of the underlying language model used for processing text data. In this project, I employed the RobeRata model as the cornerstone of our sentiment analysis pipeline. 

The Roberta model's adaptability and accuracy in processing Romanian text make it a valuable asset for sentiment analysis tasks in the Romanian language. By leveraging its capabilities, we aim to provide precise sentiment analysis results for various applications within our project.
